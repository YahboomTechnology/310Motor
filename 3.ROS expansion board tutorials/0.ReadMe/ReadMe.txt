1. This catalog tutorial case is used with the STM32-ROS expansion board. The specific model of STM32 is: STM32F103RCT6.

2. The wire sequence of the 310 motor is inconsistent with that of the STM32-ROS expansion board motor interface. 
You need to adjust the wire sequence before powering on, otherwise the expansion board will be damaged!!!
